5,34C-26-36. Bought L for both. It doesn‚Äôt look small but material doesn‚Äôt really support HIIT exercises. Maybe yoga ok. Tights thighs area a bit lose too but no restriction in movement. Wouldn‚Äôt buy sports bra again. Maybe tights only ba. Cheap deal though! ,Positive

5,"Delivery took super long this time round, took 3 and a half weeks. Love this design, it is very flattering. Bought this in S first but it felt too tight even though the size given was right, so I had to repurchase it in M. For reference, my under bust is 71cm. Recommend to size up.",Positive

5,Received as advertised. Good material,Positive
5,"Got a sports bra and leggings, would recommend leggings more as it is very comfy and smooth. The sports bra is of a different brand than moving peach, and the material is not as buttery as the leggings. Took quite a while to get the stuff, ordered on 05/05 and only came on 27/05.",Positive

5,"The top was quite comfortable, sizing runs quite small. Recommended to size up, which i did but its still slightly tight but not uncomfortable! ",Positive
5,"I wear an Adidas size S / 34A and M fits perfectly - snug but does not suffocate you. Material is thick, smooth and comfortable, but is more cotton-y than regular sports bras, so it does not wick sweat very well. The bra gives medium support - works well for HIIT, but idk how it'll hold in the wash!",Positive
5,"Delivery was a bit slow but probably due to COVID. Item received as per image and description. I‚Äôm a UK8 and got size L, it was comfortable with allowance. Material is soft and smooth! ",Positive

5,Stretchy material and fits well. Reasonable price for this quality. ,Positive
4,"Nice and comfy. But, I find it less stretchy than the other design that I had bought, and it's tighter at the calf area. Due to the stitching/patterns on the pants, have to be careful when pulling up the pants, if not I scare that it might tear. Deep pockets, considering to buy yellow color! ",Positive

However the material is not really sweat absorbant when i did hot yoga. Cant really complain as the price is pretty good. ",Positive
5,Items came nicely packed :) ordered the wrong size & seller was willing to help me change before shipping them out. Colour looks more like grey with a bit of olive green. Still loving it! Thank you!,Positive
5,"Material is great, super comfortable and worth it. Not thin at all when stretched out as long as seamless underwear is worn. The seller also replies fast when I chatted for advise on sizing. Im a usual UK 4-6 and S fits me well. Idk abt M but if you want a looser fit M would work too? ",Positive

5,"Finally it's here! material is actually not too bad, does have the new fabric smell (should go away after sunning it). lightest for me was black, followed by grey and then pink (heaviest). came with an instruction guide on different ways to use the band too, not bad! let's hope it lasts. ",Positive
5,So worth the purchase as the quality is amazing. Also survived a machine wash since I'm a germaphobe I always wipe or wash whatever I buy. Totally recommend. ,Positive
5,Recieve in good condition although delivery took quite awhile. Resistance band quality feels great but have yet to try it out. ,Positive
3,"Not as per description. Feels like grey has the higest resistance, followed by pink then black.
Thick and won't slip, but material doesn't seems to worth the price.",Positive

5,Good one!!,Positive
5,great colour and texture,Positive
5,The black band a bit too loose in my opinion. Mostly use the pink one. But good buy. Happy with the purchase!,Positive
5,Pretty good! But the black one feels lighter than the gray? Overall good though. Bands are super thick üí™üèª,Positive
5,"The resistance level listed on the listing vs actual product resistance is different. Black is lightest, followed by grey, then pink is heaviest. Small issue, can easily tell the difference when using anyway.",Positive

5,Came in good quality! But the resistance of the bands are not according to the listing. Black is the lightest for mine and grey is the heaviest. ,Positive
5,Order at 6 Jun and receive on 12 Jun. The grey one was the hardest while the black was the easiest. Overall the band is great. Just the colour to intensity is wrong which is no big issue to begin with. Can feel the intensity differences.,Positive
5,"Delivered in a reasonable amount of time.
 Good quality. Reasonable for its price. Bought one piece from another seller at almost half of the price of this set, But its too big on me. Hence I purchase another set, surprisingly its exactly the same quality less the tag.hope they put a resistance tag",Positive
